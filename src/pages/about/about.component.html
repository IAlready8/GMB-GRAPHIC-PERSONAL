        I8 IS A CREATIVE STUDIO. WE DON'T MAKE PRETTY THINGS. WE FORGE VISUALS WITH A PULSE. RAW, UNFILTERED, AND UNAPOLOGETIC. OUR WORK IS A REACTION AGAINST THE POLISHED, STERILE AESTHETIC OF THE DIGITAL AGE.

        <p>
          We believe in the power of the imperfect, the beauty of the brutal, and the honesty of the unrefined. We are not designers in the traditional sense; we are visual anarchists. Our canvas is the chaos of the street, and our tools are code, concrete, and courage. We exist as a necessary rebellion against a bland, homogenous digital world.

        <h2 class="font-display text-3xl font-bold tracking-wider mb-4 border-b-4 border-black pb-2">OUR METHOD</h2>
        <p>
          Our process is one of deconstruction, not just creation. We strip away the unnecessary until only the raw truth remains. We find elegance in function, and meaning in structure. Every project is an exercise in reductionism, an attempt to build something that is as honest and direct as the materials it's made from.
